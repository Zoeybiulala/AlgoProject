# AlgoProject
In order to run this project, you should run **run_main.sh** first. 
beforehand, you need to ensure there is a record.txt in your code sources file and which is empty

i.e.: 
1. check bmc_data to find the record.txt file and ensure it is empty
2. ensure you are in the right directory, i,e, no-location-constraint, 
3. type sh run_main.sh

To get a overall report, you will need to run readRecord.py. 
The average percentage fit and average time taken will be in record.txt

get_real_data.sh runs the command for all files in the brynmawr directory, using the python file get_bmc_info.py, and will generate into bmc_data in a desired format.
