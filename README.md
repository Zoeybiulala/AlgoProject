# AlgoProject

This is the readme for overall github. In our github, we have 8 branches, except for main, other 7 active branches are modified code with modified input data.

no-overlapping-time-version is the original one from checkpoint 2

with-lab-constraint is we set the condifition as having labs with special location as constraints.

with-location-constraints is the branch we make sure courses should only be assigned in those mentioned location from the input data.

with-labs-without-location-constraint is we assume we have labs but with no location constraints, i.e., special rooms

timeslots-splitted is the branch we splitted timeslot but we did not add location constraints to it.

with-location-constraint-split-timeslot is the branch we splitted each timeslots and combines the location constraints

without-location-constraints is the branch we do not have any constraints including labs, location and splitted timeslots
